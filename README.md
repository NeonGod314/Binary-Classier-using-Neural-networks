# Binary-Classier-using-Neural-networks
This program is purely written in python without using any framework

It contains 2 models
1) NN classoifier using 2 layers
2) NN classoifier using 5 layers (can be simply changed)

To use it for your own purpose, user just needs to change the pictures in class0 and class1 folders
and also in respective test folders.

For any doubt regarding this project, I can be contacted on shubhama3ps@gmail.com
